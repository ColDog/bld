# bld

Monorepo build tool. With change detection.

## Structure

- `Source`: A folder.
- `Step`: A set of commands to execute inside a container.
- `Service`: A container to be run alongside the steps.


1. For a local source, we just checksum insert into the source map.
2. For a remote source created during a previous build we want to load the
   source for a given build digest. Restore the local state to the previous state.

## Uses

- Run tests based on file changes.
- Build binaries.
- Publish a helm chart with images.
- Start up a service from a previously built image.

## Figure Out

- How to pass images from different builds through the pipeline.

## Todo:

- Docs.
- CI.
- Figure out image building.
